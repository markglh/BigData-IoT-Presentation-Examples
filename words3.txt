The Helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the narrow
defile and the territories of the Sequani, and had arrived at the
territories of the Aedui, and were ravaging their lands. The Aedui,
as they could not defend themselves and their possessions against
them, send embassadors to Caesar to ask assistance, [pleading] that
they had at all times so well deserved of the Roman people, that their
fields ought not to have been laid waste - their children carried
off into slavery - their towns stormed, almost within sight of our
army. At the same time the Ambarri, the friends and kinsmen of the
Aedui, apprize Caesar, that it was not easy for them, now that their
fields had been devastated, to ward off the violence of the enemy
from their towns: the Allobroges likewise, who had villages and possessions
on the other side of the Rhone, betake themselves in flight to Caesar,
and assure him that they had nothing remaining, except the soil of
their land. Caesar, induced by these circumstances, decides, that
he ought not to wait until the Helvetii, after destroying all the
property of his allies, should arrive among the Santones.
